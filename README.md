## ReFundly
**What is ReFundly?**

ReFundly is a simple platform that helps people resell airtime they mistakenly over-recharged. It's easy to type an extra zero and load ₦30,000 when you meant ₦3,000. Once the airtime enters your SIM, there is usually no refund and you’re stuck. 

People end up begging others to “buy airtime from them” on WhatsApp or Telegram, and many get scammed in the process.

ReFundly fixes this by providing a safe and fast way to resell extra airtime or buy airtime at a discount.
